# Functional Programming with Javascript

## Mars Dashboard

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started:

1.  For this project we are using yarn as our package manager, so to install your dependencies run: `yarn install`
2.  Next you'll need a NASA developer API key in order to access the API endpoints. To do that, go here: https://api.nasa.gov/. If you want to simply look around at what api endpoints NASA offers, you can use their provided DEMO_KEY to do this.
3.  Rename or copy the env-example file to one called `.env` and enter in your key. Now that you have your key, just remember to add it as a parameter to every request you make to NASA.
4.  Run `yarn start` in your terminal and go to `http:localhost:3000` to check that your app is working. If you don't see an image on the page, check that your api key is set up correctly.
