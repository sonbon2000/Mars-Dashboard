# Functional Programming with Javascript

## Mars Dashboard


### Instructions
#### Big Picture

Create a Mars rover dashboard that consumes the NASA API. The dashboard will allow the user to select which rover's information they want to view. Once they have selected a rover, they will be able to see the most recent images taken by that rover, as well as important information about the rover and its mission. The app will make use of all the functional concepts and practices.


### Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started:

1.  For this project we are using yarn as our package manager, so to install your dependencies run:  `yarn install`
2. Next you'll need a NASA developer API key in order to access the API endpoints. To do that, go here: https://api.nasa.gov/. If you want to simply look around at what api endpoints NASA offers, you can use their provided DEMO_KEY to do this.
3. Rename or copy the env-example file to one called `.env` and enter in your key. Now that you have your key, just remember to add it as a parameter to every request you make to NASA.
5. Run `yarn start` in your terminal and go to `http:localhost:3000` to check that your app is working. If you don't see an image on the page, check that your api key is set up correctly.
